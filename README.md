# dotfiles - Storage of all my configs
This includes config of different applications like the window managers, emacs, vim, etc alongside standard dotfiles that are a part of the Linux environment.

# WARNING
I'm migrating my dotfiles to be better compatible with nixos. Refer to the "arch-linux" branch for normal Linux
